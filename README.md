# go-router - networking inspired muxing

This is a networking-inspired model. It's useful for muxing and lots of other
things. It enables you to construct your abstractions as you would compose
computer networks (endpoints, switches, routing tables). These could represent
processing workers, entire subsystems, or even real computers ;).
